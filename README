#FakeDNS:
A small, dirty and fake dns server written in ruby.
It starts a DNS service which listens on wanted ip-address and reply
on all queries received.

## Requirements
Ruby 2.5

## Install
Debian Enviroment:

 sudo gem install fakedns-VERSION.gem
 
## Usage
Since we are using lower ports (in this case 53) you need to run the 
program with super user privileges.

Ex: (Assuming nothing else is running on that port)
sudo ./fakedns.rb --interface vboxnet0
